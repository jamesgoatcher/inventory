A few years ago I thought I’d give it a try assuming my bewilderment was do to being a child. No, this game is just soiled refuse written in French, translated to Japanese, and finally translated into English. Avoid it if you’ve never played it. Cherish it if you grew up with it.",

Back to the game: the junctioning system removed the need for grinding so I could focus on the story, the characters had more heart than any other game, the music was PERFECT, and the implied plot twist that revealed Squall and Rinoa to be the offspring of star-crossed lovers Laguna and Raine is one of the most beautiful works of fiction rendered in any medium.

        "notes": "I started reading and collecting Mad back in 1993. My dad read Mad as a kid and at the time it was pretty much the same magazine put out by the same Usual Gang of Idiots. I loved Spy vs. Spy, the Lighter Side of..., the fold-in, all the fake ads, and most of all, the covers. I was obsessed with their diversity, up-to-date satire, and rich attention to detail. I had a subscription from 1994 until 1996 so those were collected in my youth but I started buying up more and more online back in 2015. For details on the specific issue visit <a href='https://www.madcoversite.com/covers.html' style='cursor: pointer;' target='_blank'>Doug Gilford's Mad Cover Site</a>.",
